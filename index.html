                            <p>At present, kids belong to a generation growing
								up with computers, tablets, and access to the internet. Gamebased E-Learning applications are one of the multimedia
								contents developed to support their educational necessities.
								These applications remained the same without any technical
								upgrades for decades. In addition, the homogeneity of the
								activities associated with these applications is now negatively
								highlighted. Nevertheless, kids are heading back from these
								tedious apps and show an excessive tendency to watch
								television, play video games, or access social networking sites.
								As a result, there is a growing social discourse that kids should
								be kept away from technology, mainly due to addiction and
								wastage of time. However, it is a crucial and damaging step in
								a technologically evolving world. Furthermore, existing
								applications have failed to build a precise combination of
								technology and real-world activities and objects. The proposed
								game-based e-learning application, entitled "Brainy," is
								planned for preschoolers aged three to five. It can expand the
								kids' minds and improve their various skills with more latest
								and practical activities based on the four latest technological
								features; Augmented Reality, Voice Recognition, Camera
								Object Detection and Recognition, and Pose Detection. These
								features allow kids to interact more with real-world objects
								and activities. Brainy mobile application pursues to provide
								kids with a comparable experience of wasting time, but it
								effectively devotes some of that time to education and enriches
								preschoolers' education by incorporating the technologies
								mentioned above. This application can be utilized in the
								homeplace, preschools or any other environment over any
								mobile device to encourage the kid's education</p>

                                        <p>During the preschool years, which encompass the first six years of life, kids must inquire about and search for their environment, move, explore, discover new things, and play games. Satisfying this need implies acquiring the information, skills, attitudes, and habits that will constitute the basis for kids’ life.  
The sort of time spent with children has been favorably associated with their educational and cognitive results. However, the conflicting time demands of parenthood and employment make it difficult to establish a balance between work and family time. When parents use their professions to show a positive relationship with their phones or tablets, they will have a much easier time educating their kids on utilizing smartphones efficiently. Due to these issues, there was a need of specific applications that are appropriate for kids.  
Kid’s mobile applications concept have been growing globally for decades. These applications can be divided into Game-based Learning (GBL) Apps for kids and kids' mobile games Apps. Parents strive to advance their children's education and knowledge from an early age. As an outcome, GBL applications play a major role in application stores that are designed specifically for preschoolers and in-demand of the two categories described previously.  
GBL is an innovative teaching approach that reinforces development and learning through gameplay. Numerous experts now believe that gamification in education can more effectively encourage today's entertainment-driven learners to participate in learning more deeply using meaningful storylines and game-play activities defined within the game design context. 
Nowadays, children represent a generation that grew up with computers, tablets, and internet access. Marc Prensky called this generation “digital natives”, acknowledging that digital language is an essential component of their life and that it has the potential to alter their thinking patterns. GBL apps are one sort of entertaining multimedia content developed to support digital natives’ educational necessities, and these applications are used to give education effectively and in a systematic context, such as a preschool, which seriously influences a child’s future life. That is why many researchers have tried to create a better kids GBL application. 
In terms of E-learning concept, there are typically three major components that directly influence the development of E-learning applications: kids, technology, and educators(guider). Design procedures, teaching-learning methodologies, and content are all conditioning aspects for learning in terms of technology. In terms of design, pedagogical applications for children must use graphics and actions that provide context; they must use simple and clear instructions, based on images; they must have an intuitive interface and interactivity for independent use, but also a challenging approach with multiple opportunities for success, to maintain interest. GBL apps which are developed in accordance with above terms have been popular among kids for decades, relying solely on same technology. 
However, these apps do not appear to be up to date with existing technical features. In addition, the homogeneity of the activities associated with these applications is now negatively highlighted. As a result, today's digital natives are heading back from these tedious apps, as well as tending to waste their time on other platforms. Recent studies indicates that whatever the digital media content used should be age-appropriate and meaningful to children, allowing them to explore multiple areas: intellectual, physical, and emotional while providing opportunities to enhance learning with extra-curricular activities. In fact, the question is to what extent this requirement is covered by existing game-based E-learning applications.

                                <div class="tab-pane fade" id="nav-DayTwo" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-DayTwo-tab">
                                      <p>One of the best approaches to teaching preschoolers is making them interact with natural objects. Augmented Reality sub-system of proposed system Brainy allows kids to relive the excitement and experience something they have never had before or rare to have around their homeplace(e.g., Lion and Airplane ) by replacing the existing world with a simulated one or virtual contents such as 3D Objects data into real-world at real-time. Using this technology (e.g., AR Core) allows kids to play and interact with 3D characters and objects with curiosity. This experience can assist kids in developing skills, primarily visual perceptual skills, and memory and retention. </p>  
									  <p>The Brainy e-learning application, which is proposed, is designed with many more functionalities than other research which are currently prevailing. By the proposed solution, the "Brainy" would suggest an object detection and recognition subsystem that includes letter and drawing identification technology, object detection technology, and object labeling technology. these technologies are introduced to improve real-world interaction and improve visual perceptual skills and memory of children.</p>
									  <p>The pose detection sub-system of proposed brainy application is designed to incorporate a number of features into a Kids learning application, such as pose detection missed by previous researchers. In fact, pose detection technology was used for games like [8] but it was not used for kids learning application development. That's about what this sub-system is going to fill. This gives the child the foundation they need to be strong both academically and physically. Because the future needs strong young people, not the sick.  </p>
									  <p>The E-learning, which is proposed, is designed with many more functionalities than other research which are currently prevailing. Solutions will be suggested to reduce the phone addiction of children through the Brainy application. Attempts have been made to motivate children to engage in activities with the external environment. attempts have been made to provide quality education to the child through voice recognition technology. this voice recognition technology primarily checks the children pronounce the words correctly. </p>

                                <div class="tab-pane fade" id="nav-DayThree" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="nav-DayThree-tab">
                                    <p>Children are part of a generation that grew up with computers and iPads, as well as internet access. There has been a growing social discourse over the years that children should be kept away from technology to some extent. This is a significant societal issue. However, in today's fast-paced and digitally advanced environment, it is both essential and detrimental to children's well-being to take this step. Despite this, various e-learning tools, including game-based applications, have been developed to aid in the development of children's minds and education. Their applications do not appear to be technologically updated, and these solutions have remained consistent for a decade, solely avoiding technological advancements. 

Additionally, because these e-games focus exclusively on images, there is a shift away from physical activities, crucial for children's brain development. On the other hand, the use of 2d technology is currently being utilized to teach kids about subjects they would not be exposed to on a daily basis in the real world. However, this is limited to the features specified by the application's writers. More significantly, despite several applications being used to teach children songs, vocabulary words, and letters, they do not verify the accuracy of the children's feedback and responses, such as accurate word pronunciation. As a result, a design that aids preschoolers in developing their minds or enhancing their education through seamless integration of technology and real-world activities is necessary. There is no correlation between game content and the real world or physical nature of any objects. Allowing children to interact with natural items is a highly effective method of educating them about the world. Besides, even if no technology is used, there is no way to prevent memories from fading. On the other side, via the use of augmented reality and technology, children may be able to relive the excitement and adventure, something they have never experienced before. </p>
